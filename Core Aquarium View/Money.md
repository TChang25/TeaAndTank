# Money 

While in the core aquarium view, the money is divided into four denominations.

Copper Coins, Silver Coins, Gold Coins, Platinum Coins

100 coins of each tier will upgrade into the next tier.

Example:
100 Copper -> 1 Silver
100 Gold Coins -> 1 Platinum Coin

**The inventory will display the largest denomination by default**


## Ways to obtain coins

Get rich in the following ways:

1. Raising coin-producing fish and making sure they're well-fed
2. Killing monsters/bosses
3. Collecting items from other friendlies

## Use it or lose it!

Coins do not follow the player past the core aquarium.
Once a customer has their tank managed, the player will lose all those coins and be rewarded in XP or other rewards based on coin amount

## Capacity for each coin slot

4 digits for each coin slot, 9999 being the highest number in each slot
